## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity? Commits are snapshots of changes made to files helping to track ptogress. Repository is a storage location for project files. Merging is combining changes to branches. Conflicts arise when due to overlapping of commits. Branches are isolated environments for developing or improving specific feature of a sofware. GitHub is a popular tool as it offers cloud storage for project files, collaboration, integration and automation, security and access control, and offers open-source or community support. It helps in maintaining project integrity by tracking changes and history, prevent data loss, facilitate team collaboration, avoids overwriting and conflicts, and ensures code quality.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
1. Get to github.com and register for a new account if you don't have one.
2. Head forward to the create new repo button under Repositories tab.
3. Add a README.md file if necessary or you can add after adding repo remotely.
4. Decide to make repository public or private
5. After attaining satisfaction with the set-up of repo, click the create repo button.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration? Provides context, improves onboarding, improves collaboration, acts as a reference, enhances project visibility.


## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects? a public repository you can push the code without the need of ssh key an in the github official site, the repository will be public to other users or even those who don't use github.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project? Commits are snapshots of changes made in the project files. git checkout master, touch big.txt, git add big.txt, git commit -am 'changes made', git push origin main

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow. Branching works using command "git branch" to check different branches existing remotely. "git branch -b master" creates anew master branch. "git checkout <branch name>" is used to enter into the specified branch name.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request? Is a mechanism used to propose changes to a repository, helps in facilitating code review and collaboration in a team before deciding to merge changes to the main branch.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful? It create a copy of someone's repo and brings it to your account. Forking create a separate copy of a repo under your account while cloning create a copy of the same repo locally on your machine. It is vital when contributing to open-source, experimenting, maintaning decaprecated projects etc

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts. These are tickets for reporting bugs, requesting features, propose improvements, and collaboration. Example are issues for task management like fixing date format of a certain feature.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration? Merge conflicts. Failing to update a branch over a long time. Pushing to wrong branch. Poor commit messages. Unecessary or large files in the project.
